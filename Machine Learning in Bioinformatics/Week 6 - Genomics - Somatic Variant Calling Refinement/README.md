This week’s task was to evaluate three alternative ML models to a provided Random Forest model which was used to solve the somatic variant refinement problem and to compare their performance to the Random Forests solution. 
For the evaluation of the models the ROC curve as well as the most important features have been utilized.

The three chosen estimators here are Logistic Regression, Extra Trees and the MLP(CNN) estimators.
