This is a small compilation of notebooks from the module Machine Learning in Bioinformatics.
In general, the weekly tasks consisted of having to reproduce results from genomics-oriented papers. 
In most cases, these papers introduced new data-pre-processing frameworks and software for the processing of blood sample generated raw data, which enabled an (optimized) application of machine learning for classification and regression of genomics related diagnostics.

Presented here are merely the used notebooks for the application of ML, which often include some additional data pre-processing as well as some analysis of the ML performance.
